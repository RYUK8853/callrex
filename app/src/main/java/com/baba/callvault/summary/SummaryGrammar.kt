/**
 * The shape a summary is physically unable to break.
 *
 * Asked politely for strict JSON, Gemma returned a `summary` string with no closing quote and the
 * whole object failed to parse. That is not a wording problem: a small model under a token cap drops
 * a quote, and "return valid JSON" is a request. A grammar is not a request — tokens that would
 * break the structure are removed from the candidates before the pick, so malformed output cannot be
 * produced at all.
 *
 * **The keys are fixed and ordered.** A grammar cannot express "these keys in any order" without
 * becoming large and slow, and fixing the order costs nothing: the model has no reason to prefer one.
 * It also means a parser can rely on every key existing, which removes a whole class of null checks.
 *
 * **Two fields from the original design are absent, deliberately.**
 * - `participants`: measured, it read the ringtone marker `*ביב*` as a person and named them.
 *   Confidently wrong names are worse than no names. It returns when diarisation can supply them.
 * - `sentiment`: low value, and being confidently wrong about the tone of someone's private
 *   conversation is a bad trade for a word nobody asked for.

     * GBNF for the summary object.
     *
     * **Every rule is on one line.** GBNF ends a rule at the newline, so a `root` spread over
     * several lines parses as several broken rules — "expecting name". Worse, that failure is
     * silent in practice: the native side logs it and generates unconstrained, so the output looks
     * plausible and the constraint simply is not there. It was caught by running the grammar
     * through llama-cli on a desktop, which refuses to start rather than carrying on.
     *
     * `string` allows the standard JSON escapes, so a Hebrew summary containing a quotation mark
     * cannot produce a document that fails to parse — which is the entire point of being here.
     *
     * **The arrays are bounded, and that is what stops the repetition loop.** They used to be `*`,
     * so "at most N items" was only a request in the prompt while the grammar permitted infinitely
     * many — which is the textbook setup for the failure we actually saw ("four decisions, three of
     * them the same sentence"). Holtzman et al. (ICLR 2020, Table 1) measured greedy decoding
     * falling into a repetition loop in 73.66% of generations, the worst configuration in the paper.
     * `{0,n}` is real GBNF — `parse_sequence` in the pinned `llama-grammar.cpp` handles `{m,n}` and
     * rewrites it into n optional rules — so a first item followed by at most
     * [MAX_LIST_ITEMS] - 1 more terminates by construction.
     *
     * Bounding it here rather than in the sampler is deliberate. `repeat_penalty` cannot tell
     * "looping" from "listing the eighth item"; it would buy termination by making long lists
     * impossible, which is the opposite of what the lists are for.

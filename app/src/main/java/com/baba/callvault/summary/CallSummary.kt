/**
 * A model's account of a call, once it has stopped being text and become data.
 *
 * The fields are the ones [SummaryGrammar] can physically produce, and no others. Two from the
 * original design are absent on purpose — `participants`, because it read a ringtone marker as a
 * person and named them, and `sentiment`, because being confidently wrong about the tone of
 * someone's private conversation is a bad trade. [parse] ignores both if an older prompt asks for
 * them, so their return is a change to the grammar rather than a migration.
 *
 * **Parsed with `org.json`, not a serialization library.** The shape is six known keys produced
 * under a grammar; that does not justify adding a compiler plugin to the build. Room stores the
 * document [toJson] returns, so encoding and decoding are the same code path the model's own output
 * takes — one parser, exercised by every summary that has ever been read.

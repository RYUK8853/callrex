/**
 * What must happen after the app is replaced, as a decision that can be tested without a device.
 *
 * **Why this is its own type.** The rule used to live inside the broadcast receiver as an early
 * `return`, and it was wrong in a way nothing could catch: recovery was skipped whenever
 * `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` survived the update, on the reasoning that there was then nothing to heal.
 * But healing the grant was never the only thing an update breaks — **the update also kills the
 * privileged recorder and stops our foreground services.**
 *
 * Measured cost, 2026-09-06: an update at 11:35:05 stopped the services (`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_STOP` at
 * that second). At 11:42:59 a call came in; the app woke, started recording 14 s later, ran for eleven
 * minutes and wrote nothing, because there was no daemon to capture through. **A 13-minute call was
 * lost, and the next call — after something else had restarted the daemon — recorded perfectly.**
 *
 * So the invariant, pinned by its own test: **[ensureRecorder] is true in every case.** An app replace
 * must never leave the phone unable to record the next call.

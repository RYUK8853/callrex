/**
 * Grants the app needs that only a shell-uid process can make: app ops, and roles.
 *
 * Runs inside [RecorderServiceImpl], so it works identically whether that was started by our own ADB
 * daemon or by Shizuku — both are uid 2000. Modelled on ShizuCallRecorder's `ShellCommandExecutor`,
 * which does the same three things, and like theirs it needs **no root**: everything here is in the
 * shell user's own permission set. Verified as shell on an emulator, 2026-08-24.
 *
 * **Every grant is read back rather than believed.** Measured that day:
 *
 *  - `appops set --user 0 <pkg> <op> allow` — works.
 *  - `appops set --user 0 --uid <uid> <op> allow` — **exits 0 and does nothing** when the op backs a
 *    runtime permission (`RECORD_AUDIO`, `READ_PHONE_STATE`, …); the system logs "Ignored setUidMode
 *    call for runtime permission app op". Not offered here at all: an API whose success means nothing
 *    is worse than no API. Upstream offers it and documents it as taking priority, which was true on
 *    older releases and is now a trap.
 *  - `cmd role add-role-holder --user 0 <role> <pkg>` — works, but refuses a package that does not
 *    *qualify* for the role. CallVault is refused `android.app.role.DIALER` with "not qualified …
 *    missing RequiredComponent … action='android.intent.action.DIAL'" because it declares no dialer
 *    component. **Root would not change that**, and neither would Shizuku: it is a statement about the
 *    manifest, not about privilege.
 *
 * Some OEMs block these outright — ColorOS refuses `appops set` from shell — so a false answer here
 * must stay false rather than become an optimistic true.
